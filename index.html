                Problem Statement
            </h1>

            <p>
                When individuals cohabitate there should be an agreed upon division
                of household labour and clear communication. When there is not clear 
                communication, individuals might not understand their responsibilities 
                and the deadlines expected of them. They might not even agree with the 
                tasks. These failures of communication result in individuals not receiving 
                recognition for their work, unequal distribution of labour, unmet deadlines,
                 and general feelings of discontent and tension in the house.

            <p>
                How might we design a mobile application to increase the completion of 
                assigned tasks by their expected deadlines and insure continued discussion
                 about happiness toward the current division of labour?

                One of the most common locations where cohabitation occurs is in college which
                allows our team to have several personal experiences to help us gain an
                understanding of our potential user base. One of the most common locations where 
                cohabitation occurs is in college which allows our team to have several personal
                experiences to help us gain an understanding of our potential user base. These 
                stories centered around inner household conflicts or grievements that roommates 
                tend to have.

            <p>
                We used our understanding of the current pain points of chores: issues
                with communication, responsibilities, deadlines, and agreement upon tasks and
                looked developed personas that we could see experiencing issues.
