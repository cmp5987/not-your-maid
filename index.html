                Problem Statement
            </h1>

            <p>
                When individuals cohabitate there should be an agreed upon division
                of household labour and clear communication. When there is not clear 
                communication, individuals might not understand their responsibilities 
                and the deadlines expected of them. They might not even agree with the 
                tasks. These failures of communication result in individuals not receiving 
                recognition for their work, unequal distribution of labour, unmet deadlines,
                 and general feelings of discontent and tension in the house. 
            </p>  

            <p>
                How might we design a mobile application to increase the completion of 
                assigned tasks by their expected deadlines and insure continued discussion
                 about happiness toward the current division of labour?
            </p>

                Identifying the User
            </h1>

            <p>
                One of the most common locations where cohabitation occurs is in college. As our team 
                consists of college students we have easy access to our target demographic and their
                personal stories about cohabitation. These stories centered around inner household 
                conflicts or grievements that roommates was used to develop a list of current pain points.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the first complaints we tended to hear was how messy kitchens could get. As a 
                shared space, if dishes or cooking supplies are left out, the next person in the kitchen
                might just be adding to a pre-exsisting mess. Studying interactions based around kitchen 
                chores would lead to interesting pain points and really highlight differences in task 
                completion and organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                We took these stories and recognized they could be grouped into four types: failure to agree 
                upon responsibilities and deadlines, issues recalling tasks, and issues with communication. 
                In order to get feedback that would be representitive of our future consumers, our particpants
                will be made up of college students must have atleast one roommate. These goals and painpoints
                are reflected and further expanded upon whhen we developed our Personas.

            <p>
                The mood board below shows the direction of design choices to keep in mind when designing 
                the application. It should be clean and neat to compliment the idea of the task list as
                well as remind users of a journal or a handwritten list without the issues that come
                along with them.

                Contemplating Solutions  
            
            </h1>

            <h3>Task List</h3>
            <p>
                All users will be able to view the task list for their household as well as
                create new tasks for them or their roommates. While viewing a specific task they will 
                be able to see who is supposed to complete it, when it should be completed by, see the
                bulleted description of the task, and leave comments. This will allow users to track
                who is doing what task and identify if they are meeting their deadlines. To accommodate
                different organization styles, a calendar view will show tasks based on their deadlines.
            </p>
            <h3>Monthly Survey</h3>
            <p>
                A monthly survey will be sent to all users in a household in order to track their 
                happiness of the tasks being completed. Roommates will be given feedback about how 
                their roommates responded to know if tasks are being completed in a positive manner.
                This allows roommates to make sure everyone is on the same page and happy with the
                results of the tasks.
            </p>
            <h3>Token Economy</h3>
            <p>
                Tasks often remain incomplete due to a failure to negatively or positively
                reinforce desired behaviors. “I’m not your maid” will attempt to provide positive 
                reinforcement for tasks by letting their fellow housemates provide ‘Kudos’ when chores
                are done. This will provide recognition and affirmation of their good behavior.
                Additionally, there will be awards for “Deadline Streak” which marks successfully completing
                all their chores for a number of weeks in a row. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Historical Feed
            </h3>
            <p>
                A section of the app will provide a historical feed of tasks completed, this 
                information will be organized into charts that can represent how evenly work is currently 
                distributed between household members as well trends for when tasks tend to be marked done.
                This portion of the app will also have the results of the overall happiness of the household
                on a monthly basis based on the monthly surveys. 
            </p>
            <h3>Notifications / Action Required</h3>
            <p>
                This portion of the app will work toward notifying the users
                when their have an upcoming task or other action is required within the app. A phone 
                notification can be used to remind the user that a task is due by the end of that day.
                It also will be an easy spot for users to see the tasks that they need to still need to
                take action on (accept or reject assignments of tasks).

                Low-fi User Testing
            </h1>

            <p>
                Due to restrictions from social distancing, there was a division in how the User Testing was completed rather than a uniform standard used for all participants.
                In an ideal situation, our team desired to have all five participants have ages ranging from 18 to 30 as this would be closer to our ideal demographic. Instead, our age demographic ranges from 20 - 56 years old, which can lead to 
                slightly different results in the assumed knowledge of our particpants in terms of knowlege of apps and organization techniques. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tasks were completed using an Invision prototype either in person or with the help of google hangouts. In person testing used an andorid phone to display the application protoype where the online testing used a web emulator of an android device and screen sharing. Participants were asked to complete a series of tasks and observed. 
                After completing each task, they were asked to rate how difficult they found it from a 1 to 5 with 1 symbolizing little to no difficulty and a five symbolizing extreme difficulty. After participants completed a set of five tasks,
                they were asked some simple open ended questions to get broader suggestions for improvement.

                <li>Do you have any other suggestions or ideas for improvement that came to mind when using the app?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Summary of Results</h3>

            <p>
                Out of the five tasks which users were asked to complete, task four and five experienced the lowest difficulty rating which may suggest either that the task was most intuitive or that familiarity with the app decreased difficulty. 
                In future testing, these tasks should be randomized to reduce the chance novelty and infamiliarity are the reason that earlier tasks are rated as more difficult. A consistent theme in comments for early tasks was confusion about 
                information avaliable on the landing page(action required) as participants expected all tasks to be listed there during the second task. Another pain point was a difference in visual language for how to interact with tasks verses alert notifications. 
                In the Follow-up Questions section of the testing, participants responded that they were hesistant to adopt this application to organize their chores because they felt that their household/roommates would be reluctant to use new technology. The most common
                suggestion for a future feature was the ability to add repetitive tasks to minimize the labour in creating a new one.

            <h1>Plans for Transition to Hi-Fi</h1>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Ensure that there is a single language for clickable items. Items which do not have interactions should appear to be on the base layer, items which have interactions should stand out and have a closer or more layered design. This will hopefully reduce the issues with expected and actual interactions avaliable for earlier tasks. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    While it is important for users to see actions required of them, for new users, the landing page of actions required can lead them to be confused with how to add new tasks or find tasks not mentioned on this page. For this reason, the landing page after login should be changed to the task list. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It would be helpful if there were details about the usage of the app before a user signs in, as most users would stay signed in, this content would give a brief introduction of the technology to the user so they understand how it should be used and what goal it hopes to solve. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Participants strongly desire the ability to reuse tasks once created. There should be an option to repeat a task regularly or to use the details of an old task when creating a new one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users want the ability to view more details about the tasks that they are assigned without having to go into the edit mode of the task.

            <p>
                As restrictions from COVID-19 continue, testing was split between discord and in person to be able to collect a necessary sample size. 
                In person participants were the same individuals who participated in the low-fi testing but two new individuals were recruited for the online/discord mediated testing.
                Four of five participants in the user testing identify as male and the ages of the particpants ranged from 21-56 years old.
                Additional psychographic data that is noteworthy is that every participant rated their fluency with technology as strong.  
                Tasks were completed using the inVision prototype.
                 Results from each task were noted using either a hand held pad or text document.

            <p> The navigation tasks were ones that were carried over from the low-fidelity user testing.
                As many of the tasks were rated as having the lowest level of difficulty during the low-fidelity testing,
                only tasks which received above the lowest difficulty rating were repeated. 
                The hopes of this would be to confirm that changes to the navigation as well as the inclusion of color and depth would help reduce the difficulty.

            <p>
                         The first task recieved a higher level of difficulty in this version of user testing compared to the prior version of user testing.
                        One individual required further explanation about difficulty rating prior to completing the task as they misunderstood the question and believed that they were rating the difficulty of cleaning up left overs from the fridge.
                        Three out of the five individuals struggled at first to find the alert page and spent a portion of time examining the task list page for the task request.
                        When asked to rate the task these three individuals gave the task a difficulty of three out of five. 
                        Most comments suggested that they expected a task request to also appear on the task list and not just in the notification portion of the app. 
                        This point seems extremely valid and I believe that this new finding was a result of the task list becoming the landing page rather than the alert page. 
                        This issue was most likely there during the previous task but due to the alerts being the landing page, users were able to spot the task request without struggling with navigation. 
                        Users who rated this task as a 1 in difficulty stated that they expected a request to be an alert and while still skimming the task list page were quick to navigate off of it.

                Task #2 Results
            </h4>

            <p>
                This task was rated as not difficult(1) by all participats of the user testing.
                When asked to explain why they found this task not difficult they said that the experience was very streamline. Very little thought was required and they new exactly what to click. 
                I believe the difficulty of this task was reduced by creating the task list as the landing page. Very little had to be inferred by the participants.

            <h4>
                Task #3 Results
            </h4>

            <p>
                One of the five individuals had given this task a 2 out of 5 for the difficulty rating. 
                When asked why they choose this rating, the individual stated that the repeated task of 'taking out the trash' that was shown on task list page was confusing to them. 
                Since the page is titled 'All Tasks', they expected that the task to take out the trash for Amy that was visible there was the one that they should interact with. 
                All other participants rated this task a 1 out of 5. In future versions the title of the tasks should clarify that it contains only active or current tasks. Additionally, perhaps there could be a view where it does not display shared or unassigned tasks as they can clutter the page.

            <h3>
                Identifying Actionable Items Testing
            </h3>

            <p>The purpose of these tasks is to see if users can understand what items on the page are clickable/actionable. 
            On each page tasted, participants will be asked to point out each item that they believe is clickable.
            The sucessfulness of the design will be graded on how many clickable items are correctly identified out of the total. 
            This will help us guage if our design successfully uses depth and color to convey actionable information. As an improvement based on the low-fi project, we added color and shadowing to clickable objects as previously users were unsure what they could interact with.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Based on results from Replication Study of Task #1, there needs to be modifications to the Task List Page as well as the Alert Page. The Task List Page needs to either include task requests like the way they show unassigned tasks or improve the clarity that only accepted and current/future tasks are shown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on the results from the Replication Study of Task #3, there needs to be more information about tasks or a way to distinguish if they are completed or historical. This task brought up the potential issue of how repeated tasks should show up on this page.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Based on the results from the Actionable Items Study of the Task List Page, there is confusion on if Amy's items are actionable and a slight depth of shadow for clickable items may not be a strong enough tool to identify what is interactable. 
                    A potential solution may be removing Amy's items from this page and creating a seperate page that just shows housemates chores. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall it seems like there needs to be time spent rethinking and organizing the way to display historical tasks, housemates tasks, personal tasks, unassigned tasks, and task requests.
